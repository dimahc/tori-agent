and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Documentation portal (`website/`) — VitePress static site with marketing homepage, per-agent pages, lifecycle tools reference, architecture, decisions, principles, and changelog. Deployed automatically to GitHub Pages on push to `main`.
- Documentation website now generates LLM-friendly artifacts (`llms.txt`, `llms-full.txt`, per-page `.md` files) via `vitepress-plugin-llms`, making the docs easily ingested by AI agents.
- The team-lead now proactively suggests the `gardener` agent after scope delivery, before releases, and when multiple doc files were touched in a session — rather than waiting for the user to ask. A dedicated Gardener Protocol section defines the triggers, rules, and how to handle its results (including escalation to `harness` when recurring patterns are detected).
- A new architecture/design-quality reviewer now runs when a change introduces a new module or service boundary, catching coupling and boundary problems the review cluster previously had no mandate to flag.

### Changed
- The team-lead's context management instructions now reference only `compress` — `distill` and `prune` were removed since they don't exist in OpenCode's toolset.
- Reviewer agents (`requirements-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, `security-reviewer`) now access files directly via `read`, `glob`, and `grep` — sub-agent spawning is blocked by the default `"*": "deny"` rule.
- The `review-manager` now accesses files directly via `read`, `glob`, and `grep` instead of delegating to an `explore` sub-agent. Its `task` permission is constrained to `*-reviewer` agents only.
- The `bug-finder` agent now investigates directly via `read`, `glob`, and `grep` — sub-agent delegation via `task` has been removed. The agent reports its findings back to the caller instead of applying fixes itself.
- The `harness` and `planning` agents now require user confirmation before spawning any sub-agent (`task: ask`).
- Review reports now stay flat across multi-round reviews instead of growing — resolved issues are referenced by ID instead of being re-printed, and clean "no issues" verdicts collapse to a single line.
- Reviews now short-circuit to a requested-changes verdict on failing lint or tests before spawning any reviewers, saving the cost of a full review pass on changes that don't even build cleanly.
- The team-lead's context-compression trigger is now a concrete rule (tied to review rounds and delegated-agent count) instead of a vague "when it feels heavy" instinct.

### Fixed
- The `planning` and `brainstorm` agents no longer fail with permission errors when their target directories (`docs/exec-plans/`, `docs/briefs/`, `docs/specs/`) don't exist in the user's project — the plugin now creates them automatically on session start via a `session.created` event hook.
- The `brainstorm` agent can now create new brief files from scratch — `write` permission on `docs/briefs/**` was missing, preventing file creation (only `edit` was allowed, which requires the file to already exist).
- The `planning` agent can now create new exec-plan files from scratch — `write` permission on `docs/exec-plans/**` was missing, preventing file creation (only `edit` was allowed, which requires the file to already exist).

### Removed
- The scratchpad working-memory file (`.opencode/scratchpad.md`) has been removed. The team-lead now tracks session progress via `todowrite` and resumes work by re-reading exec-plans and specs, rather than maintaining a separate persistent memory file.

## [0.9.0] - 2026-05-04

### Added
- New `researcher` agent for external knowledge research — fetches and synthesizes information from the web, official docs, APIs, and public sources during the comprehension phase (before planning)
- New `brainstorm` agent — helps developers discover and articulate what they want to build before planning starts. Run it before the team-lead to produce a structured product brief at `docs/briefs/{project-name}.md`.
- New `harness` agent — encodes emerging patterns as permanent mechanical enforcement artifacts (lint rules, CI workflows, AGENTS.md entries, guiding principles). Triggered by the user, the team-lead post-feature, or the Gardener on recurring drift.
- New `planning` agent — transforms complex or ambiguous requests into structured work contracts on disk (`docs/exec-plans/`). Returns inline plan simples for small tasks; full exec-plans for multi-session work.
- New `gardener` agent — periodic maintenance agent that fixes stale documentation and detects code drift against established rules. Opens targeted PRs; updates `QUALITY_SCORE.md`; escalates recurring patterns to `harness`.
- The team-lead now knows when to invoke `planning` (complex/ambiguous requests) and when to suggest `harness` post-delivery (recurring patterns).
- Five lifecycle tools now available directly to the team-lead — no delegation needed for project bookkeeping: `project_state` (full artifact inventory), `check_artifacts` (consistency scan), `mark_block_done` (check a block in an exec-plan), `complete_plan` (close a scope), and `register_spec` (create a new spec file). The team-lead calls these at mission start and after each delivery automatically.
- Exec-plans now support an optional `brief:` frontmatter field to trace the brainstorm → implementation link bidirectionally.

### Changed
- The `brainstorm` agent now challenges your assumptions before drafting — Phase 2 applies Socratic pressure on stated assumptions and constraints, and a mandatory adversarial gate runs before the brief is written: the agent presents the strongest case against building the product and asks what would cause it to fail. Briefs are stronger as a result.
- The `brainstorm` agent now hard-blocks on incomplete briefs — if the Problem statement, Success Criteria, or Scope In are missing or unresolved, the brief won't be drafted until those gaps are closed. Cosmetic disagreements are noted as open questions; substantive ones block the output entirely.
- Scope inflation is now flagged throughout the brainstorm session — if the in-scope list grows to 5 or more items, the agent surfaces it once and asks what's truly essential.
- Harness now operates fully autonomously — it explores the codebase, decides what to encode, and acts without asking for confirmation at each step. It only stops in three explicit cases: the pattern can't be mechanized, encoding requires creating a new workflow file, or the trigger is too vague with no codebase signal to anchor it.
- The soul personality layer now applies to all agents with `mode: "all"` (brainstorm, planning, bug-finder, harness, gardener) — previously only the team-lead benefited from it
- The `bug-finder` agent now includes a pattern assessment in every output — flags whether the bug is a systemic pattern and recommends invoking `harness` when the root cause can be mechanically encoded
- The `review-manager` can now read any file directly — it no longer needs to spawn an `explore` sub-agent to read source files before reviewing

### Fixed
- Lifecycle tools (`project_state`, `mark_block_done`, `complete_plan`, `register_spec`, `check_artifacts`) now return valid responses — previously the `execute` functions returned raw objects instead of strings, causing the OpenCode plugin API to silently discard their output
- Harness agent now has full `bash`, `read`, `write`, `edit`, `glob`, and `grep` permissions — previously it was registered with a restricted command allowlist and scoped file targets, which prevented it from running arbitrary lint commands or writing enforcement artifacts outside the predefined list.
- The harness agent no longer writes human-facing checklists to `AGENTS.md` — it now correctly identifies them as documentation and routes them to CI checks or `docs/guiding-principles.md` instead. An unwired script in the repo is also no longer treated as a valid enforcement artifact.
- Brainstorm agent now enforces a hard stop before responding to the user — the `docs/briefs/` scan is mandatory regardless of how much context the user provides at session start, preventing the agent from skipping existing brief detection
- Planning agent write/edit permissions now correctly allow files directly in `docs/exec-plans/` (not just subdirectories)
- Planning agent can now read `AGENTS.md`, `README.md`, and `docs/**` — the `"*": "deny"` in the `read` sub-object was blocking all file reads
- Lifecycle tools (`project_state`, `register_spec`, `mark_block_done`, `complete_plan`, `check_artifacts`) now work correctly when OpenCode passes `worktree="/"` — the plugin falls back to `directory` instead of treating the filesystem root as the project root
- Planning agent can now read project files and create exec-plans — permission rules were blocking `read` access and missing `glob`/`grep` tools needed for codebase exploration
- Removed invalid `write` permission key from all agent configs — OpenCode's permission system uses `edit` to govern all file modifications (write, edit, patch); the separate `write` key was silently ignored, causing new file creation to be blocked by the top-level `"*": "deny"` rule

### Removed
- `memory.md` concept removed — the persistent project memory feature has been deprecated. The `experimental.chat.system.transform` hook and memory.md injections have been removed from the plugin. Only the scratchpad survives compaction. See [why persistent agent memory is an anti-pattern](https://azrod.me/en/articles/agent-memory-antipattern/).

## [0.8.0] - 2026-03-30

### Added

- New `bug-finder` agent — a structured bug investigation orchestrator that forces root-cause analysis before any fix is applied. Prevents the team-lead from rushing to workarounds that mask symptoms and create code divergence.
- Persistent memory across sessions — the team-lead now maintains `.opencode/memory.md`, a project-level knowledge base that accumulates architecture decisions, conventions, and user preferences. The plugin injects it automatically into every session via `experimental.chat.system.transform`, so it's available from the first message without any tool call.
- The default soul directives are now in English — previously the built-in personality guidelines were in French, which was unexpected for non-French speakers. Disable with `soul: false` if you prefer a neutral voice.
- The team-lead now prefers registered user-defined agents over invented personas — when a project defines domain-specific agents (e.g., `languages/typescript-pro`, `mcp/mcp-developer`, `web/react-specialist`), the team-lead selects them instead of defaulting to a `general` + invented persona name

### Changed

- The `review-manager` is now significantly faster for trivial changes — it instantly approves docs-only or formatting updates without spawning sub-agents, and only spins up a single `code-reviewer` for low-risk tweaks.
- The reviewer delegation prompt has been drastically slimmed down — the `review-manager` no longer wastes tokens re-explaining focus, stance, or formatting to specialized reviewers that already know their job.

### Fixed

- Reviewer agents (requirements, code, security) now have a hardcoded skeptical stance in their system prompts — this counteracts the default LLM approval bias where agents would spot real issues but rationalize them away instead of flagging them.

### Removed

- `sequential-thinking` has been removed — modern models decompose complex workflows natively, making the explicit planning tool unnecessary friction
- The "What you MUST NOT do" tool list has been removed — the Cardinal Rule and Anti-Patterns section already cover this constraint more effectively
- The delegation prompt template (the 5-section ## Context / ## Task / ## Files / ## Constraints / ## Deliverable scaffold) has been removed — modern models structure delegations well without an explicit template, and the surrounding prose conveys the substance
- In-Flight Delegations tracking from the scratchpad template has been removed — the compaction hook already preserves the full scratchpad, making the urgent task_id recording instruction redundant
- The Self-Evaluation numbered checklist has been collapsed to prose — the core checks (original request coverage, multi-agent coherence, scope drift, side effects) are preserved but without the mechanical 6-item format
- The `< 1-2 delegations away` interruption threshold has been removed from the scope-switching protocol — the metric was unmeasurable and the principle (park state, switch, return) stands without it
- The "When NOT to Prune" subsection has been removed from the Context Management section — all three bullets described actions a model wouldn't take anyway
- The "Max Retries" column has been removed from the error handling retry table — the "2 total attempts → escalate" rule in prose is the one that matters, the per-cause counters were redundant and contradictory

## [0.7.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added

- Three specialized reviewer agents are now included: `requirements-reviewer`, `code-reviewer`, and `security-reviewer` — the review-manager spawns them automatically based on change type and risk level (size × risk axes), and always runs `requirements-reviewer` on non-trivial reviews; high-risk patterns (auth, SQL, crypto, secrets) force `security-reviewer` regardless of change size
- The team-lead can now embody a personality — embed your tone and communication directives in the plugin and the team-lead applies them automatically in every session. Disable with `soul: false` in your `opencode.json` agent config if you prefer a neutral voice.

### Fixed

- Overriding a permission key in `opencode.json` no longer silently drops the plugin defaults for that key — your custom permissions are now merged on top instead of replacing the entire group
- In-flight delegations are now tracked in the scratchpad with their `task_id` — if compaction hits while a delegation is running, the team-lead can resume without losing track of what was dispatched
- Adding the `requirements-reviewer` no longer reduces technical review coverage — functional and technical reviews now run in full, independently

## [0.6.2] - 2026-03-19

### Changed
- The team-lead agent was given the name **Orion** — referenced throughout the system prompt and documentation (since removed).

## [0.6.1] - 2026-03-13

### Removed

- Removed the memoai memory integration — the team-lead no longer uses `memoai_memo_search` and `memoai_memo_record` to record decisions or search past context across sessions

## [0.5.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- The team-lead now proactively manages its context window — clear guidance on when to distill, prune, and compress tool outputs to prevent compaction surprises
- The scratchpad now tracks the active task in detail (sub-tasks, files being modified, resume context) — if compaction hits mid-step, the team-lead can resume exactly where it left off instead of losing implementation details

## [0.4.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- The team-lead now consistently delegates reviews to the review-manager instead of spawning reviewer agents directly — reinforced with explicit constraints in three places across the prompt

## [0.4.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Reviews are now handled by a dedicated review-manager agent that spawns specialized reviewers in parallel and arbitrates disagreements — the team-lead no longer manages reviews directly
- The review-manager agent can be customized from `opencode.json` just like the team-lead (temperature, color, permissions)

## [0.3.1] - 2026-02-20

### Fixed

- The team-lead now reads and writes its scratchpad (`.opencode/scratchpad.md`) directly — previously it couldn't maintain its working memory due to missing file permissions

## [0.3.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Agent properties and permissions can now be customized from your `opencode.json` — override temperature, color, or add extra tool permissions without forking the plugin

## [0.2.1] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- The team-lead can now manage its context window using DCP tools (`distill`, `prune`, `compress`) — keeping sessions clean across long conversations

## [0.2.0] - 2026-02-20

### Changed

- npm package now ships with provenance attestation for supply chain verification

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

- Initial release of the team-lead orchestrator plugin for OpenCode
- npm package with installation docs
